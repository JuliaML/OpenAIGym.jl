This wraps the open source python library `gym`, released by OpenAI.  See [their website](https://gym.openai.com/) for more information.  Collaboration welcome!

### Hello world!

```julia
using OpenAIGym
env = GymEnv("CartPole-v0")
for i=1:20
    R, T = episode!(env, RandomPolicy())
    info("Episode $i finished after $T steps. Total reward: $R")
end
```

If everything works you should see output like this:

```
INFO: Episode 1 finished after 10 steps. Total reward: 10.0
INFO: Episode 2 finished after 46 steps. Total reward: 46.0
INFO: Episode 3 finished after 14 steps. Total reward: 14.0
INFO: Episode 4 finished after 19 steps. Total reward: 19.0
INFO: Episode 5 finished after 15 steps. Total reward: 15.0
INFO: Episode 6 finished after 32 steps. Total reward: 32.0
INFO: Episode 7 finished after 36 steps. Total reward: 36.0
INFO: Episode 8 finished after 13 steps. Total reward: 13.0
INFO: Episode 9 finished after 62 steps. Total reward: 62.0
INFO: Episode 10 finished after 14 steps. Total reward: 14.0
INFO: Episode 11 finished after 14 steps. Total reward: 14.0
INFO: Episode 12 finished after 28 steps. Total reward: 28.0
INFO: Episode 13 finished after 21 steps. Total reward: 21.0
INFO: Episode 14 finished after 15 steps. Total reward: 15.0
INFO: Episode 15 finished after 12 steps. Total reward: 12.0
INFO: Episode 16 finished after 20 steps. Total reward: 20.0
INFO: Episode 17 finished after 19 steps. Total reward: 19.0
INFO: Episode 18 finished after 17 steps. Total reward: 17.0
INFO: Episode 19 finished after 35 steps. Total reward: 35.0
INFO: Episode 20 finished after 23 steps. Total reward: 23.0
```


Note: this is equivalent to the python code:

```python
import gym
env = gym.make('CartPole-v0')
for i_episode in xrange(20):
    total_reward = 0.0
    observation = env.reset()
    for t in xrange(100):
        # env.render()
        # print observation
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        total_reward += reward
        if done:
            print "Episode {} finished after {} timesteps. Total reward: {}".format(i_episode, t+1, total_reward)
            break
```

We're using the `RandomPolicy` from Reinforce.jl.  To do something better, you can create your own policy simply by implementing the `action` method, which takes a reward, a state, and an action set, then returns an action selection:

```julia
type RandomPolicy <: AbstractPolicy end
Reinforce.action(policy::AbstractPolicy, r, s, A) = rand(A)
```

Note: You can override default behavior of in the `episode!` method by overriding `Reinforce.on_step(env, i, sars)` or by passing your own `stepfunc`.  You could also just iterate yourself:

```julia
ep = Episode(env, policy)
for (s, a, r, sâ€²) in ep
    # do something special?
    OpenAIGym.render(env)
end
R = ep.total_reward
N = ep.niter
```

### Install gym

First install `gym`. Follow the instructions [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs) if you're using a system-wide python, or to use Conda.jl:

```julia
Pkg.add("PyCall")
withenv("PYTHON" => "") do
   Pkg.build("PyCall")
end
```

then install gym from the command line:

```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym
cd gym
~/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/bin/pip install -e .[all]
```

For additional environments, use a similar process.  For example, here's how I installed [Soccer](https://github.com/openai/gym-soccer) on my Ubuntu machine:

```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/LARG/HFO
cd HFO
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
make install

cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/openai/gym-soccer
cd gym-soccer
~/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/bin/pip install -e .
```

and here's how I installed the ones based on Box2D (for example BipedalWalker-v2) since it didn't work out of the box (due to [this issue](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/100)):

```
~/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/bin/pip uninstall box2d-py
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev swig
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d
cd pybox2d/
~/.julia/v0.6/Conda/deps/usr/bin/pip install -e .
```

### Install OpenAIGym and Reinforce

The easiest way to get started is with [MetaPkg](https://github.com/tbreloff/MetaPkg.jl):

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/tbreloff/MetaPkg.jl")
using MetaPkg
MetaPkg.meta_add("MetaRL")
```

which will install OpenAIGym, [Reinforce.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/Reinforce.jl), and the [JuliaML](https://github.com/JuliaML) Learn ecosystem.  You might also want to install the [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) ecosystem with `MetaPkg.meta_add("MetaPlots")`.


To do the install manually, add this julia package:

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaML/OpenAIGym.jl.git")
```

and until it's registered in METADATA, you'll also need to manually install [Reinforce.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/Reinforce.jl):

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/JuliaML/Reinforce.jl.git")
```
